# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This repository is a Next.js starter template with Supabase integration. Follow these guidelines when contributing code.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode enabled)
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth, Database)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS Variables
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (New York style)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Theme**: next-themes for dark/light mode
- **Auth**: Supabase SSR with cookie-based authentication

## Project Structure

- `/app` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `/components` - React components (including shadcn/ui components in `/components/ui`)
- `/lib` - Utility functions and shared code
- `/utils` - Additional utility functions
- `/supabase` - Supabase configuration and migrations

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Define proper types for all props and function parameters
- Avoid using `any` type - use `unknown` or proper types instead
- Use type inference where possible, but be explicit for public APIs
- Follow ESLint rules configured in `eslint.config.mjs`

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer Server Components by default (App Router pattern)
- Add `"use client"` directive only when client-side features are needed (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- Use proper component naming: PascalCase for components, kebab-case for files
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility

### File Organization

- Place reusable components in `/components`
- Use the `/app` directory for routes following Next.js App Router conventions
- Co-locate route-specific components with their routes when they're not reusable
- Create utility functions in `/lib` or `/utils`

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- Follow the established design system using CSS variables defined in `globals.css`
- Use the `cn()` utility from `@/lib/utils` for conditional className combinations
- Respect the dark mode implementation using `next-themes`
- Custom colors: Primary purple gradient (`--brand-primary-light`, `--brand-primary-medium`, `--brand-primary-dark`, `--brand-primary-darker`) (see `globals.css`).
  The `brand` prefix is a placeholder for your project's custom color palette. Please customize these variable names and color values to match your own branding and design system.

### Supabase Integration

- Use `@supabase/ssr` for authentication in Server Components
- Create Supabase clients using the utilities in `/utils/supabase`
- Follow cookie-based authentication patterns
- Handle auth state properly in both client and server contexts
- Use Server Actions for data mutations when possible

### Forms and User Input

- Use shadcn/ui form components (Label, Input, Button, etc.)
- Implement proper form validation
- Handle loading and error states
- Provide clear feedback to users

### Path Aliases

- Use `@/` prefix for imports (configured in `tsconfig.json`)
- Example: `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"`

## Best Practices

### Performance

- Minimize client-side JavaScript by preferring Server Components
- Use proper Next.js Image component for images
- Implement proper loading states and Suspense boundaries
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders

### Security

- Never commit `.env.local` or sensitive credentials
- Use environment variables for API keys and secrets
- Validate all user input on both client and server
- Follow Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) best practices

### Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide proper ARIA labels where needed
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- shadcn/ui components have good accessibility defaults - maintain them

### Error Handling

- Handle errors gracefully with try-catch blocks
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Use Next.js error boundaries for page-level errors
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

## Development Commands

> **Note:** This project officially supports and tests only `npm` as the package manager. Using `yarn` or `pnpm` is not recommended and may result in deployment errors unless you manually maintain the corresponding lockfile (`yarn.lock` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`) and resolve any issues yourself. Only `npm` is guaranteed to work in CI/CD and deployment, **due to Vercel deployment requirements**.

**Start development server**

- `npm run dev`

<!--
**Unofficial commands for alternative package managers (unsupported):**
- `yarn dev`
- `pnpm dev`
-->

**Build for production**

- `npm run build`

<!--
- `yarn build`
- `pnpm build`
-->

**Start production server**

- `npm run start`

<!--
- `yarn start`
- `pnpm start`
-->

**Run ESLint**

- `npm run lint`

<!--
- `yarn lint`
- `pnpm lint`
-->

## Testing

- Currently, no testing framework is configured.
- When adding tests, consider the following:
  - **Unit and integration tests**: Recommended frameworks are Jest (https://jestjs.io/) or Vitest (https://vitest.dev/) with React Testing Library (https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for React components.
  - **End-to-end (E2E) tests**: Consider using Playwright (https://playwright.dev/) or Cypress (https://www.cypress.io/).
  - Use TypeScript for all test files.
  - Place test files alongside the code under test or in a `/tests` directory, following repository conventions.
  - Update these instructions and document any new testing setup or patterns you introduce.

## Additional Notes

- The font families used in this starter kit should match those configured in the project (see Tailwind CSS and global styles for details)
- The app supports both light and dark themes
- Environment variables need to be configured in `.env.local` (see `.env.example`)
- Supabase URL and anon key are required for the app to function

## Runtime & CI (updated)

- Preferred Node.js runtime for local development and CI: Node 20.x (update docker/devcontainer images and CI runner to Node 20).
- Use npm as the canonical package manager in CI (Vercel and our pipelines expect npm lockfile handling).
- Vercel: free-tier rate limits apply. If you see "api-deployments-free-per-day" errors, either retry later or consider upgrading the plan / throttling CI deployments.

## Security / System files (important)

- Do NOT edit system-level files under /usr/lib, /usr/local, or other OS-level directories from the workspace.
- If you need to patch a dependency installed globally or in node_modules system-wide, use approved strategies:
  - Fork the package and reference it in package.json
  - Use npm patch-package or a supported patch workflow
  - Open a proper repo PR to the dependency
- Attempts to modify system files will fail due to permissions and may break the development container.

## Troubleshooting tips

- If devcontainer fails with 'unable to find user codespace' or similar, confirm your devcontainer config and base image support the current user mapping.
- If Next.js fails on startup with EADDRINUSE, either stop the process on that port or run on a different port:
  - PORT=3001 npm run dev
  - On Alpine Linux: lsof -nP -iTCP:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN && kill -9 <PID>
- If tests fail due to missing `ts-node` or jest binary, run:
  - npm ci
  - npm install --save-dev ts-node
  - Ensure your test runner is present in dev and CI images.

## Alpine Linux notes

- This workspace is running in a dev container on Alpine Linux v3.22.
- Some common commands available: `apk`, `git`, `curl`, `lsof`, `netstat`, `ps`, etc.
- Use `"$BROWSER" <url>` to open a webpage in the host's default browser.
