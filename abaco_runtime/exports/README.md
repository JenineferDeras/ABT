# ABACO Runtime Export Artifacts

The files in this directory are generated by the production Supabase pipelines.
Each sub-folder contains materialized extracts that are synchronized to the
analytics lake every night at 01:00 UTC. All exports are encrypted at rest and
validated against the governed schemas documented in
[`ABACO_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`](../../ABACO_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md).

| Folder       | Contents                                       | Refresh cadence |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `analytics/` | Curated feature tables for AI workflows        | Daily           |
| `dpd/`       | Delinquency and collections extracts           | Hourly          |
| `kpi/`       | Executive KPI snapshots (includes nested JSON) | Daily           |
| `pricing/`   | Rate cards and limit assignments               | Daily           |

Do not commit generated CSV or JSON exports. The ingestion workers populate the
folders automatically during runtime.
