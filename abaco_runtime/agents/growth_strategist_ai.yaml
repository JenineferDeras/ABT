notes: |
  Diego is the innovative, experiment-driven growth strategist.
  Uses Gemini for scenario synthesis, OpenAI for detailed calculations.
  Safety rule: no spend increases if churn elevated without mitigation.
  All new channels must pilot successfully before full rollout.
  Focus on LTV/CAC optimization across 4 channels (KAM, Digital, Embedded, Partner).
