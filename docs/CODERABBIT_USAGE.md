## 📋 Review Request File

We've created `.github/CODERABBIT_REQUEST.md` that documents what to ask CodeRabbit to review. You can reference this in PR descriptions:

```markdown

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Tag CodeRabbit in comments** to ask questions about specific code sections
2. **Use `@coderabbit generate` commands** to auto-generate tests or documentation
3. **Review CodeRabbit's suggestions** - they're usually spot-on but not always applicable
4. **Close PR #1** - It contains outdated code and will confuse CodeRabbit
